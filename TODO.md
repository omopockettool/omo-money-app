# OMOMoney - SwiftUI Expense Tracker App Development TODO

## Project Overview
Building a native iOS personal expense tracker app using SwiftUI (iOS 16+) with strict MVVM architecture, Core Data persistence, and NavigationStack navigation building into the view model for simplicity.

## Development Strategy
- **Incremental Development**: Small, focused commits for each feature
- **MVVM First**: All business logic in ViewModels, Views only display
- **Core Data Foundation**: Start with data model, build UI on top
- **Test-Driven**: Unit tests for each component
- **Physical Device Testing**: Always test on physical device, not simulator

### Performance Considerations
- Use background queues for Core Data operations
- Implement proper error handling
- Optimize for smooth UI updates
- Follow Apple's native UI/UX conventions

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Data Foundation âœ…
- [x] Create project structure and configuration files
- [x] Create Core Data model entities
  - [x] Category entity
  - [x] Entry entity  
  - [x] Group entity
  - [x] Item entity
  - [x] User entity
  - [x] UserGroup entity
- [x] Create ViewModels for each entity
- [x] Update Core Data model file
- [x] Optimize ViewModels for native performance
- [x] Implement background queues for Core Data operations

### Phase 2: Basic UI Structure ðŸš§
- [x] Create main navigation structure with NavigationStack
- [x] Implement basic list views for User entity
- [x] Add/Edit forms for User entity
- [x] Basic CRUD operations in UI for User entity
- [ ] **NEXT: Create Group from User functionality**
  - [ ] Add "Create Group" button in User detail view
  - [ ] Create Group creation form
  - [ ] Link User as owner of the new Group
  - [ ] Create UserGroup relationship automatically
- [ ] Implement basic list views for other entities
- [ ] Add/Edit forms for other entities
- [ ] Basic CRUD operations in UI for all entities

### Phase 3: Business Logic
- [ ] Implement expense calculation logic
- [ ] Add category management
- [ ] Group sharing functionality
- [ ] User authentication flow

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] Charts and analytics
- [ ] Export functionality
- [ ] Notifications and reminders
- [ ] Data backup and sync

### Phase 5: Polish & Testing
- [ ] UI/UX refinements
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Comprehensive testing
- [ ] App Store preparation

## Current Focus
ðŸš§ **IN PROGRESS**: Phase 2 - Basic UI Structure. Next step: Create Group from User functionality.

## Completed Work

### Core Data Entities âœ…
1. **Category** âœ… - Expense categories with color coding and group relationships
2. **Entry** âœ… - Main expense entries with dates, descriptions, and relationships
3. **Group** âœ… - Expense groups for sharing between users with currency support
4. **Item** âœ… - Individual items within expense entries with amounts and quantities
5. **User** âœ… - App users with authentication and group membership
6. **UserGroup** âœ… - Junction table for user-group relationships with role management

### ViewModels âœ…
1. **CategoryViewModel** âœ… - Full CRUD operations with filtering and validation
2. **EntryViewModel** âœ… - Full CRUD operations with date filtering and total calculations
3. **GroupViewModel** âœ… - Full CRUD operations with member counting and sorting
4. **ItemViewModel** âœ… - Full CRUD operations with amount calculations and filtering
5. **UserViewModel** âœ… - Full CRUD operations with email validation and role checking
6. **UserGroupViewModel** âœ… - Full CRUD operations with role validation and permissions

### UI Components âœ…
1. **MainView** âœ… - Root navigation with NavigationStack
2. **UserListView** âœ… - List of users with add/edit/delete functionality
3. **UserRowView** âœ… - Individual user row component
4. **AddUserView** âœ… - Form to create new users
5. **EditUserView** âœ… - Form to edit existing users

### Architecture Features âœ…
- **MVVM Compliance**: All business logic in ViewModels, Views only display
- **Core Data Best Practices**: Proper delete rules, relationship management
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback
- **Data Validation**: Input validation for emails, roles, and business rules
- **Performance**: Efficient filtering, sorting, and calculation methods
- **Native Performance**: Background queues for Core Data operations
- **UI Thread Safety**: @MainActor for all ViewModels

## Next Steps
1. **Create Group from User** - Add functionality to create a group from user detail view
2. **Group Management UI** - Implement basic list views and forms for Group entity
3. **User-Group Relationships** - Implement UserGroup management UI
4. **Category Management** - Implement Category entity UI
5. **Entry Management** - Implement Entry entity UI
6. **Item Management** - Implement Item entity UI

## Commit History
- âœ… **Commit 1**: Category entity and ViewModel
- âœ… **Commit 2**: Entry entity and ViewModel  
- âœ… **Commit 3**: Group entity and ViewModel
- âœ… **Commit 4**: Item entity and ViewModel
- âœ… **Commit 5**: User entity and ViewModel
- âœ… **Commit 6**: UserGroup entity and ViewModel
- âœ… **Commit 7**: Complete MVVM architecture with native performance optimizations

## Technical Notes
- All entities implement `Identifiable` protocol for SwiftUI compatibility
- ViewModels use `@MainActor` for UI thread safety
- UserViewModel uses background queues for Core Data operations
- Proper Core Data delete rules implemented (Cascade, Nullify)
- Comprehensive computed properties for formatted display
- Utility methods for common operations and filtering
- NavigationStack implementation for modern iOS navigation
- Strict MVVM architecture with no business logic in Views
