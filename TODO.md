# OMOMoney - SwiftUI Expense Tracker App Development TODO

## Project Overview
Building a native iOS personal expense tracker app using SwiftUI (iOS 16+) with strict MVVM architecture, Core Data persistence, and NavigationStack navigation building into the view model for simplicity.

## Development Strategy
- **Incremental Development**: Small, focused commits for each feature
- **MVVM First**: All business logic in ViewModels, Views only display
- **Core Data Foundation**: Start with data model, build UI on top
- **Test-Driven**: Unit tests for each component
- **Physical Device Testing**: Always test on physical device, not simulator

### Performance Considerations
- Use background queues for Core Data operations
- Implement proper error handling
- Optimize for smooth UI updates
- Follow Apple's native UI/UX conventions

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Data Foundation ✅
- [x] Create project structure and configuration files
- [x] Create Core Data model entities
  - [x] Category entity
  - [x] Entry entity  
  - [x] Group entity
  - [x] Item entity
  - [x] User entity
  - [x] UserGroup entity
- [x] Create ViewModels for each entity
- [ ] Update Core Data model file

### Phase 2: Basic UI Structure
- [ ] Create main navigation structure
- [ ] Implement basic list views for each entity
- [ ] Add/Edit forms for entities
- [ ] Basic CRUD operations in UI

### Phase 3: Business Logic
- [ ] Implement expense calculation logic
- [ ] Add category management
- [ ] Group sharing functionality
- [ ] User authentication flow

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] Charts and analytics
- [ ] Export functionality
- [ ] Notifications and reminders
- [ ] Data backup and sync

### Phase 5: Polish & Testing
- [ ] UI/UX refinements
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Comprehensive testing
- [ ] App Store preparation

## Current Focus
✅ **COMPLETED**: All Core Data entities and ViewModels following MVVM architecture.

## Completed Work

### Core Data Entities
1. **Category** ✅ - Expense categories with color coding and group relationships
2. **Entry** ✅ - Main expense entries with dates, descriptions, and relationships
3. **Group** ✅ - Expense groups for sharing between users with currency support
4. **Item** ✅ - Individual items within expense entries with amounts and quantities
5. **User** ✅ - App users with authentication and group membership
6. **UserGroup** ✅ - Junction table for user-group relationships with role management

### ViewModels
1. **CategoryViewModel** ✅ - Full CRUD operations with filtering and validation
2. **EntryViewModel** ✅ - Full CRUD operations with date filtering and total calculations
3. **GroupViewModel** ✅ - Full CRUD operations with member counting and sorting
4. **ItemViewModel** ✅ - Full CRUD operations with amount calculations and filtering
5. **UserViewModel** ✅ - Full CRUD operations with email validation and role checking
6. **UserGroupViewModel** ✅ - Full CRUD operations with role validation and permissions

### Architecture Features
- **MVVM Compliance**: All business logic in ViewModels, Views only display
- **Core Data Best Practices**: Proper delete rules, relationship management
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback
- **Data Validation**: Input validation for emails, roles, and business rules
- **Performance**: Efficient filtering, sorting, and calculation methods

## Next Steps
1. **Update Core Data Model File** - Add all entities to the .xcdatamodeld file
2. **Test Basic CRUD Operations** - Verify all entities work correctly
3. **Create Basic UI Views** - Start with list views for each entity
4. **Implement Navigation** - Set up main navigation structure

## Commit History
- ✅ **Commit 1**: Category entity and ViewModel
- ✅ **Commit 2**: Entry entity and ViewModel  
- ✅ **Commit 3**: Group entity and ViewModel
- ✅ **Commit 4**: Item entity and ViewModel
- ✅ **Commit 5**: User entity and ViewModel
- ✅ **Commit 6**: UserGroup entity and ViewModel

## Technical Notes
- All entities implement `Identifiable` protocol for SwiftUI compatibility
- ViewModels use `@MainActor` for UI thread safety
- Proper Core Data delete rules implemented (Cascade, Nullify)
- Comprehensive computed properties for formatted display
- Utility methods for common operations and filtering
