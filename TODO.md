# OMOMoney - SwiftUI Expense Tracker App Development TODO

## Project Overview
Building a native iOS personal expense tracker app using SwiftUI (iOS 16+) with strict MVVM architecture, Core Data persistence, and NavigationStack navigation building into the view model for simplicity.

## Development Strategy
- **Incremental Development**: Small, focused commits for each feature
- **MVVM First**: All business logic in ViewModels, Views only display
- **Core Data Foundation**: Start with data model, build UI on top
- **Test-Driven**: Unit tests for each component
- **Physical Device Testing**: Always test on physical device, not simulator

### Performance Considerations
- Use background queues for Core Data operations
- Implement proper error handling
- Optimize for smooth UI updates
- Follow Apple's native UI/UX conventions

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Data Foundation âœ…

  - [ ] Entry entity  
  - [ ] Group entity
  - [ ] Item entity
  - [ ] User entity
  - [ ] UserGroup entity
- [ ] Create ViewModels for each entity
- [ ] Update Core Data model file

### Phase 2: Basic UI Structure
